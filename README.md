Google Apps Script (GAS) repository

I copy and paste rather than use Clasp (gs <==> js)

I gave up on this because web apps deployed from Google Apps Script inject a default banner with the "This application was created by a Google Apps Script user" message can disrupt the layout, especially on mobile devices

I'll try Google Forms next

I'm generally disappointed with Google Apps Script and I'm moving away from it altogether.
